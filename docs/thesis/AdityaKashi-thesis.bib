ABSTRACT = {Solving large sparse symmetric positive definite systems of linear equations is a crucial and time-consuming step, arising in many scientific and engineering applications. This paper considers the block partitioning and scheduling problem for sparse parallel factorization without pivoting. There are two major aims to this study: the scalability of the parallel solver, and the compromise between memory overhead and efficiency. Parallel experiments on a large collection of irregular industrial problems validate our approach.}
