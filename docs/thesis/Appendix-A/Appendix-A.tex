\chapter{Delaunay tessellation algorithm}

Here, the exact algorithm used for the Delaunay tessellation in the context of Delaunay graph mapping (DGM) methods is explained. The method broadly follows the one used by Bowyer \cite{bowyer}. 

The Delaunay process maximizes the minimum angle in a simplex. Implementation of the ``Delaunay kernel" is done such that orientation of elements and faces is preserved.

\chapter[Spline reconstruction]{Spline reconstruction of a piecewise-linear boundary}

The exact process used to reconstruct a twice-differentiable ($C^2$) boundary from the piecewise-linear boundary of a linear mesh is described below.
