\begin{abstract}

This report describes methods of mesh movement for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. The methods described can be classified into two families - elasticity-based methods and interpolation methods. The former class includes lineal and torsional spring analogy methods and linear elasticity method and its variants. Interpolation methods described here include the `Delaunay graph' mapping, interpolation by radial basis functions, and a combination of Delaunay graph mapping and radial basis function interpolation. The merits and disadvantages of these methods have been discussed, and some two-dimensional test cases have been presented.

\begin{acknowledgements}
First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor Professor Hong Luo for guiding and advising me without reservation throughout my time at NC State. Next, I thank my committee members Professors Jack Edwards Jr and Pierre Gremaud, for teaching me important concepts and agreeing to be on my MS defense committee. I am also thankful to my colleagues at the CFD lab - Aditya Pandare, Xiaodong Liu, CHuanjin Wang, Chad Rollins, Jialin Lou and Dr Xiaochuan Yang for always entertaining my questions and discussing things when required.
