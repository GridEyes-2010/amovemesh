\chapter{Conclusion}

A lot of choice is available for mesh-movement techniques, but only a few will be good for a given application. We conclude that interpolation methods are generally well-suited for unsteady simulations that require mesh movement, as they are very fast. When deformations are relatively small and not highly rotational, DGM is a good choice while when larger and more general deformations are needed, DGRBF is best. The pure RBF method, while usually giving good robust results, is more expensive than other interpolation methods considered here. 

RBF, and elastic solid analogy methods, are found to be effective for curved mesh generation, where computational cost is less of an issue. We have used RBF for curved mesh generation with good results for certain viscous flow cases.
